--  This package is intended to be used in conjunction with its parent unit,
--  Ada.Command_Line. It provides facilities for getting command line arguments
--  from a text file, called a "response file".
--
--  Using a response file allow passing a set of arguments to an executable
--  longer than the maximum allowed by the system on the command line.

   --  Raise by Arguments_From when a quoted string does not end before the
   --  end of the line.

   --  it contains as an Argument_List. It is the responsibility of the caller
   --  to deallocate the strings in the Argument_List if desired. When
   --  Recursive is True, any argument of the form @file_name indicates the
   --  name of another response file and is replaced by the arguments in this
   --  response file.
   --
   --  Each non empty line of the response file contains one or several
   --  arguments separated by white space. Empty lines or lines containing only
   --  white space are ignored. Arguments containing white space or a double
   --  quote ('"')must be quoted. A double quote inside a quote string is
   --  indicated by two consecutive double quotes. Example: "-Idir with quote
   --  "" and spaces" Non white space characters immediately before or after a
   --  quoted string are part of the same argument. Example -Idir" with "spaces
   --
   --  When a response file cannot be found, exception File_Does_Not_Exist is
   --  raised if Ignore_Non_Existing_Files is False, otherwise the response
   --  file is ignored. Exception Line_Too_Long is raised when a line of a
   --  response file is longer than Max_Line_Length. Exception No_Closing_Quote
   --  is raised when a quoted argument is not closed before the end of the
   --  line. Exception Circularity_Detected is raised when a Recursive is True
   --  and a response file is reading itself, either directly or indirectly.
