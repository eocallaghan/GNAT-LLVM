--  This package is an internal package that provides basic character
--  classification capabilities needed by the compiler for handling full
--  32-bit wide wide characters. We avoid the use of the actual type
--  Wide_Wide_Character, since we want to use these routines in the compiler
--  itself, and we want to be able to compile the compiler with old versions
--  of GNAT that did not implement Wide_Wide_Character.

--  This package is available directly for use in application programs,
--  and also serves as the basis for Ada.Wide_Wide_Characters.Unicode and
--  Ada.Wide_Characters.Unicode, which can also be used directly.

--  See file s-utf_32.ads for full documentation of the interface

with System.UTF_32;

package GNAT.UTF_32 renames System.UTF_32;
