--  Operating system interface facilities

--  This package contains types and procedures for interfacing to the
--  underlying OS. It is used by the GNAT compiler and by tools associated
--  with the GNAT compiler, and therefore works for the various operating
--  systems to which GNAT has been ported. This package will undoubtedly grow
--  as new services are needed by various tools.

--  This package tends to use fairly low-level Ada in order to not bring in
--  large portions of the RTL. For example, functions return access to string
--  as part of avoiding functions returning unconstrained types.

--  Except where specifically noted, these routines are portable across all
--  GNAT implementations on all supported operating systems.

--  See file s-os_lib.ads for full documentation of the interface
